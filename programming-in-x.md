# Programming in "X"

## Basics 
- Variables
- Conditionals
- Looping
- Arrays
- Functions
- Formatted Output
- Random Numbers 
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
  + classes and objects
  + subclasses and superclasses
  + abstract classes and interfaces
  + Enums
- Nulls and Exceptions
- Collections
- Generics
- Lambdas and Higher-Order Functions
- Coroutines
- Annotations

## Use-Case Driven
- IO
  + Console
  + File
- Encode/Decode Data (JSON, YAML)
- Locale
  + Data/Time
  + Currency
- Logging
- Testing

## Simple Koans
- Create Rock, Paper and Scissors game
- Create a Class Hierarchy: Employee, Manager, Executive
- Create a List of Employees. Loop through it
- Read and Write to and from a File
- Traverse Directory. Check if a file exists. If it is readable, writable.
- Read from and write to a JSON file
- Use Locale, Number Formatting and Currency Formatting to print money in acceptable format in US, UK, Germany and India 
- Use Dates to find current date in different timezones, difference between two dates, a future date and a past date
- Create a /hello API returning JSON payload of the string sent
- Create a client that interacts with httpbin APIs
- Writing apps that interact with PostgreSQL
- Writing apps that interact with MongoDB
- Writing apps that interact with Redis
- Post messages to Kafka. Write consumes to read the message

## Software Delivery
- Use an IDE (JetBrains-based or VSCode)
- CI/CD Pipeline (Code, Build, Artifact, Deploy)
- Containerized (or Serverless) Package
- Deploy to a Container Orchestrator (or Serverless) Platform
