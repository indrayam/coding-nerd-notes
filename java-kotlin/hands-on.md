# Hands-On Skills

All Apps use IntelliJ IDEA, Gradle w/ Kotlin, Unit tests using JUnit 5 (w/ Hamcret and AssertJ) and Mockito. Also, they are packaged as Docker images

## Basics
- Create an App that implements Rock, Paper and Scissors game where user's input is received from the Console
- Create an App that implements a Class Hierarchy: Employee, Manager, Executive
- Create an App that implements a List of Employees and perform all kinds of operations on it
- Create an App that Reads and Writes from/to a CSV file
- Create an App that Reads and Writes from/to a JSON file
- Create an App that traverses a folder structure and prints file and folder name with additional file/folder attributes
- Create an App that uses Locale, Number Formatting and Currency Formatting to print money in acceptable format in US, UK, Germany and India 
- Create an App that uses Dates to find current date in different timezones, difference between two dates, a future date and a past date

## Building Apps
- Create RESTful API returning JSON payload
- Create RESTful API that in turn acts as a REST client by displaying JSON results from httpbin (or other public) APIs
- Create RESTful API that interacts with PostgreSQL
- Create RESTful API that interacts with MongoDB
- Create RESTful API that interacts with Redis
- Create RESTful API that that posts messages to Kafka/RabbitMQ
  + Create an eWorker that reads messages from Kafka/RabbitMQ
- Create a Serverless App
