# Coding Nerd Notes

## Phase 1: Love at first sight!
- My very first programming language was [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran), back in 1991. This was in my 2nd year of college, where I was pursuing an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering. It was :heart: at first sight. To say that Fortran is the reason why I eventually switched my major and career to Computer Science would be 100% accurate.
- In my final year of college, I took a course where I got exposed to [COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL). I can't say the language did anything for me. As a matter of fact, I am still not sure I understand why the language was such a **huge** commercial success, especially in business/finance. Perhaps some day I will care to actually understand :wink:
- In fall of 1995, when I moved to States to pursue my Masters in Industrial Engineering with a focus on Information Systems, I built my first web site using [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML). 
- [Perl/CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGI.pm) development came soon after in Spring of 1996. After Fortran, Perl was the next language that truly got me excited! [Perl by Example](https://www.amazon.com/Perl-Example-5th-Ellie-Quigley/dp/0133760812) was my go to book to learn as much as I could about writing backend code for web apps. It all seemed like magic. I was hooked. For life!
- During my Masters program, I took two courses that made me write tons of [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) software. And yes, I learnt and wrote C++ before I even wrote a single line of C. To say that I got pretty good at it would not be a hyperbole. However, lack of access to Unix-based desktop meant I would have to learn C++ on Windows. MSDN subscription cost and not getting easy access to Visual Studio definitely impeded my plans around C++. That said, I think the prospect of understanding and dealing with [Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Foundation_Class_Library) and [DLLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library) scared me away from C++! I continue to fantasize that some day I will go back to learning and writing LOTS of C++ software. We will see if that happens :smile:
- In Summer of 1996, I got my first exposure to serious Unix when I became a co-System Admin for an IS Lab in ASU's College of Education. While it was just a summer job, I had in my full possession an [SGI Workstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Graphics) with admin access. The roots of my :heart: for all things Unix can be traced back to the excruciatingly hot summer days of 1996.

## Phase 2: Web Applications and Web Services Developer
- Summer of 1996 is when I had my first date with [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) and [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/). 
- From 1997 to 2004, I did a lot of [Java] software development  running it on servlet containers like [JRun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_JRun), [Borland Inprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland), [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) and [IBM Websphere](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-application-server). In all cases, the context of my development was for Web Apps, although it later switched to being more and more for Web Services. This meant I spent most of my time writing [Java Servlets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Servlet) and a bit of [Java Server Pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Server_Pages). I never got comfortable with running [JBoss](https://www.jboss.org/) and hence, never got into writing much of any Enterprise Java Beans (EJB).
- While I was always a backend developer, I did not completely ignore the web frontend space. I did get myself fairly competent with CSS and dealing with the DOM using JavaScript. That said, the nuances of making JavaScript work in the browser in late 1990s to early 2000s was nothing short of painful. Upon reflection, these challenges with making JavaScript work was such a turn off that I never really got into JavaScript. [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) was definitely a welcome introduction in the world of JavaScript, just like [Spring framework](https://spring.io/) was in the world of Java Stateless and Stateful Enterprise Java Beans (EJB).
- During this time, I did dabble a little with [Active Server Pages (ASP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages) and a decent amount of [PHP](https://www.php.net/). Most of my PHP work was driven by my interest in running a blog for me and my dad powered first by [Movable Type](https://www.movabletype.org/) and then later by [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)
- My :heart: for Unix morphed into me finding the red fedora! Yes, I was a HUGE FAN of [Red Hat Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux) in the early days. I remember driving to [Borders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borders_Group) bookstore in Miliptas, California, to buy the latest RedHat Linux CDs. I did everything from compiling Linux kernel features to fantasizing that it will become my primary operating system someday.

## Phase 3: Software and Solutions Architect
- Someone in Cisco Systems thought I was quite good in Microsoft PowerPoint and Visio, not to mention "talking"! They made me an IT Architect in 2005.
- This role allowed me to look at designing and building "solutions" for our internal and external customers at Cisco. I was quite miserable at first as it seemed like the role took me away from writing software, the one thing that I actually enjoyed! In hindsight, it was perhaps the best thing that happened to turning me into an all-rounded IT professional.
- The following list covers some of the bigger initiatives that I have gotten involved in over the years as an IT Architect:
  + **Cisco Developer Network:** Building Cisco's very first stab at building a true software development community using social computing tools like blogs, vlogs and wikis.
  + **Migrating Cisco IT Apps to [Metro Virtual DCs](https://blogs.cisco.com/ciscoit/ciscos-other-production-data-center) in Texas:** Infrastructure, especially Compute and Network, became an obsession of mine for a number of years leading up to 2010. Why? Cisco was moving their entire IT compute footprint from bare metal servers in a few campus buildings in San Jose to two Tier 3+ DCs in Texas. This was my first exposure to the world underneath an operating system! I tried soaking up as much as I could - server virtualization, hypervisors, data centers, challenges of data centers, need for redundant power supply, cooling, ISP connections etc. I even got a chance to visit Cisco Webex's main data center in Mountain View!
  + **Enterprise App Store for [Cisco Cius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Cius):** In the early days of iPad, everyone was angling to see if there was a business opportunity to be had inside an Enterprise using this novel device. Cisco's Cius was an Android-based laptop meant for Enterprise use. We worked on trying to put together an **App Store** for Cius. While the implementation of the store came quite a bit further along in a very short amount of tiem, the actual tablet as a product never really took off. And neither did our App store :wink:
  + **Empowering Cisco Partners via Web APIs:** Amazon's success with AWS using [Web APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API) clearly showed Cisco could do a lot better in empowering our partners and possibly opening up new revenue streams. Using [Mashery's](https://developer.mashery.com/) amazing API Management platform, we built quite an impressive looking API portal for our partners, one of the first AWS hosted Cisco IT solution of the time. Implementing our first API Management solution, and Mashery's first hybrid implementation of their API Management platform, meant that I got into the weeds of all things Identity and Access Management (IAM)! Things like Single Sign-On using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Federated Identity Providers, [OAuth 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) (for securing our Web APIs), [XACML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XACML) and, last but not least, [REST APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)!
  + **Cisco IT Mobile Apps Software Development Kit (SDK):** Over the years, Cisco has built many value-added software on top of the Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) enterprise software which together powered Cisco business. With the explosion of Mobile Apps in the Consumer space, there was a sense that mobile apps would explode within Cisco IT as yet another channel of driving productivity for both internal and external customers. While the effort never really morphed into anything significant, it allowed me to dive even more into the world Identity and Access Management (IAM). Why? Our most successful offering was an Objective-C (for iOS apps) and Java (for Android apps) SDK that made it trivial for teams to integrate Cisco Single Sign-On (SSO) in their mobile apps. 
  + **Transforming Cisco IT's Software Delivery by embracing Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** As I alluded to earlier, Cisco IT teams do write a lot of software. However, prior to 2015, software delivery was primarily waterfall-*ish*. In 2014, a major initiative was launched to transform our software delivery by embracing CI/CD. Our goal was simple: Empower Cisco IT teams to deliver high-quality and secure software at speed! This project led me into the world of DevOps and then quickly descended into the weeds! I have spent the last five years obsessing about every aspect of Cisco software developer's experience.
    - It started with offering an integrated toolchain. [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) as a [DVCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control), [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) as a [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) tool, [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) as an universal artifact manager and UrbanCode Deploy and Release (later, [Spinnaker](https://spinnaker.io/)) as deployment/release pipeline tool.
    - Since then, it has evolved into all aspects of Software Developer Experience (DX): Create (or edit) an end-to-end CD pipeline stack for a software, Release their software while complying with all security and compliance controls and, Provide DevOps Analytics to the teams about their Development Practices as well as Software characteristics.
- While I continued to dabble with writing software, I was writing it for me as opposed to Cisco. To no one's surprise, I got into writing more and more [Python](https://www.python.org/). Sometimes I wonder if I should have embraced Python instead of Perl during my CGI writing days. That said, I enjoyed my time with Perl. So, no regrets there. :smile: 

## Phase 4: Learning to Write Software for Me, not for Money!
- My :heart: for C++ never really went away. However, instead of diving into [C++ 17](https://isocpp.org/std/status), I've decided it is time for me to move on
- Languages on my radar:
  + [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): For systems programming
  + [Go](https://golang.org/): For all other backend development needs, be it Web Apps, APIs, Serverless or CLI code.
  + [Julia](https://julialang.org/): Perhaps, Julia will bring me back full circle to a language like Fortran!
