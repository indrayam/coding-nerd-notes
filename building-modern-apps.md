- Web API that responds with a simple JSON "Hello World" payload
- Web API that integrates with *DynamoDB* (or, *MongoDB*)
- Web API that integrates with *Aurora/Postgres* (or, *PostgreSQL*)
- Web API that integrates with *ElastiCache* (or, *Redis*)
- Web API that integrates with *SNS* and/or *SQS* (or, *Kafka*)
- Lambda App that integrates with *S3*
- Lambda App that integrates with *SNS* and/or *SQS*
