## Basics 
- âœ… Variables
- âœ… Conditionals
- âœ… Looping
- âœ… Arrays
- âœ… Functions
- âœ… Formatted Output
- âœ… Random Numbers 
- ðŸš§ Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Simple Koans
- Mix Java and Kotlin in the code. Use IntelliJ IDEA and Maven to write code and generate a fat jar. Run it using `java`
- Create Rock, Paper and Scissors game
- Create a Class Hierarchy: Employee, Manager, Executive
- Create a List of Employees. Loop through it
- Read and Write to and from a File
- Traverse Directory. Check if a file exists. If it is readable, writable.
- Read from and write to a JSON file
- Use Locale, Number Formatting and Currency Formatting to print money in acceptable format in US, UK, Germany and India 
- Use Dates to find current date in different timezones, difference between two dates, a future date and a past date
- Create a /hello API returning JSON payload of the string sent
- Create a client that interacts with httpbin APIs
- Writing apps that interact with PostgreSQL
- Writing apps that interact with MongoDB
- Writing apps that interact with Redis
- Post messages to Kafka. Write consumes to read the message

## Software Delivery
- Software Delivery Tools
  + âœ… IntelliJ IDEA
  + Maven
  + GitHub/GitHub Actions
  + ECR
  + EKS
- Containerized (or Serverless) Package
- Deploy to a Container Orchestrator (or Serverless) Platform
